# Sarcasm-detection-using-RNN-LSTM

This project focuses on detecting sarcasm in text using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Sarcasm, often expressed ironically or implicitly, poses a challenge for sentiment analysis due to its ambiguous nature. The goal is to accurately classify text as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic, crucial for natural language processing applications. By leveraging a dataset of 40,000 tweets and utilizing advanced NLP techniques, the implemented model achieves a commendable 95% accuracy in sarcasm detection. This success suggests promising future directions, including exploring emoticon-based and punctuation-based features for enhanced detection.
